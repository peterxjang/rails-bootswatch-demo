# README

A quick demo of how to style a Rails app using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/), and [Bootsnip](http://bootsnipp.com/).

Bootstrap was installed using the [bootstrap-sass gem](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).
The app was styled using the Bootswatch [Paper](https://bootswatch.com/paper/) theme.
The index page was styled using this [eCommerce Product Detail](http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/ecommerce-product-detail) snippet.
